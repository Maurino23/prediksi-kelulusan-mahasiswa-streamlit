# Student Graduation Prediction with Random Forest

## 📚 Project Description
This project aims to develop a web-based machine learning application for predicting student graduation. Utilizing the *Random Forest* algorithm, this application is built with Python's *Streamlit* framework, providing an intuitive interface for users to input academic and demographic data and display prediction results in a user-friendly manner.
